# Create a Tool for the Processing open source programming language and
# environment (http://www.processing.org)
#
# Customize the build properties to make the ant-build-process work for your
# environment. How? Please read the comments below.
#
# The default properties are set for OS X. Please refer to comments for Windows
# settings.


# Where is your Processing sketchbook located?
# If you are not sure, check the sketchbook location in your Processing
# application preferences.
# ${user.home} points the compiler to your home directory.
# For windows the default path to your sketchbook would be
# ${user.home}/My Documents/Processing (make adjustments below).

#sketchbook.location=${user.home}/My Documents/Processing
sketchbook.location=${user.home}/Documents/Processing


# Where are the jar files located that are required for compiling your Tool such
# as e.g. core.jar?
# By default the local classpath location points to folder libs inside Eclipse's
# workspace (by default found in your home directory).
# For Windows, the default path would be
# ${user.home}/Documents/workspace/libs (make adjustments below)
# For OS X,the following path will direct you into Processing's application
# package, in case you put Processing inside your Applications folder.

#classpath.local.location=${user.home}/Documents/workspace/libs
classpath.local.location=lib


# Add all jar files that are required for compiling your project to the local
# and project classpath. Use a comma as delimiter. These jar files must be
# inside your classpath.local.location folder.
# For creating a Tool, both pde.jar and core.jar are required.

classpath.local.include=core.jar,pde.jar


# Add Processing's libraries folder to the classpath.
# If you don't need to include the libraries folder to your classpath, comment
# out the following line.

classpath.libraries.location=${sketchbook.location}/libraries



# (3) set the java version that should be used to compile your tool.

java.target.version=1.8


# set the description of the ant build.xml file

ant.description=processingTools. ant build file.



# (4)
# project details.
# Give your tool a name.
# when creating a tool, the name of the main class which 
# implements Tool must be the same as the value defined 
# for project.name in your build.properties

project.name=SketchOutline

# The name as the user will see it. This can contain spaces and special
# characters.

project.prettyName=Sketch Outline


# use normal or fast as value for project.compile 
# (fast will only compile the project into your sketchbook, 
# using normal as property will compile the distribution including the 
# javadoc-reference and all web-files - the compile process here
# takes longer)

project.compile=normal

# all files compiled with project.compile=normal are stored 
# in folder distribution



# (5)
# the following items are properties that will be used to
# make changes to the html document template. values of properties
# will be implemented ito the document automatically.

author.name=Manindra Moharana
author.url=http://www.mkmoharana.com/


# Set the web page for your Tool.
# This is NOT a direct link to where to download it.

tool.url=https://github.com/Simplifier/Sketch-Outline


# The current version of your Tool.
# This number must be parsable as an int. It increments once with each release.
# This is used to compare different versions of the same Tool, and check if an
# update is available.

tool.version=9


# The version as the user will see it.

tool.prettyVersion=0.1.8

# Additional information for the generated webpage.

tool.dependencies=
tool.keywords=Tool, Processing 3

# Set the category (or categories) of your Tool from the following list:
#   "3D"            "Animation"     "Compilations"      "Data"
#   "Fabrication"   "Geometry"      "GUI"               "Hardware"
#   "I/O"           "Language"      "Math"              "Simulation"
#   "Sound"         "Utilities"     "Typography"        "Video & Vision"
#
# If a value other than those listed is used, your library will listed as
# "Other". Many categories must be comma-separated.

tool.categories=GUI


# A short sentence (or fragment) to summarize the Tool's function. This will be
# shown from inside the PDE when the Tool is being installed. Avoid repeating
# the name of your Tool here. Also, avoid saying anything redundant like
# mentioning that it's a Tool. This should start with a capitalized letter, and
# end with a period.

tool.sentence=Provides an outline view of the member variables, functions and classes within a sketch and allows easy navigation between them. Similar to the outline view in Eclipse.


# Additional information suitable for the Processing website. The value of
# 'sentence' always will be prepended, so you should start by writing the
# second sentence here. If your Tool only works on certain operating systems,
# mention it here.


tool.paragraph=The list of member variables, functions and inner classes are shown in a tree view. Clicking on any node scrolls and moves the cursor to its definition in the code. Makes navigation within code fast and easy.


# The min and max revision of Processing compatible with your Tool.
# Note that these fields use the revision and not the version of Processing,
# parsable as an int. For example, the revision number for 2.2.1 is 227.
# You can find the revision numbers in the change log: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/processing/processing/master/build/shared/revisions.txt
# Only use maxRevision (or minRevision), when your Tool is known to break in a
# later (or earlier) release. Otherwise, use the default value 0.


compatible.minRevision=0
compatible.maxRevision=0
