## Sketch Outline for PDE (Processing Development Environment)

##### This repo is a fork of original [Sketch Outline for PDE](https://github.com/Manindra29/Sketch-Outline), rebuilt to be compatible with Processing 3.
-----------------------------------------------------------

Sketch Outline is a [Processing](http://www.processing.org) tool that provides an outline view of the member variables, functions and classes within a sketch and allows easy navigation between them. 
Similar to the outline view in Eclipse. 
Grab the latest version from [here](https://github.com/Simplifier/Sketch-Outline/tree/master/distribution).
